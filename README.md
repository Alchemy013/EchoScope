# Radar
"Experience the future of sensing technology with our Arduino-based radar system. This innovative device combines the precision of a servo motor with the accuracy of an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects in real-time. The servo motor sweeps the sensor in a 180-degree arc, scanning the surrounding area and providing data for detailed mapping or obstacle avoidance. Whether you're a hobbyist exploring the world of electronics or a professional seeking advanced sensing solutions, our radar system offers endless possibilities for innovation and discovery."
